# 3D OpenGL Application - Bomb Drop
For my first year of university I was required to use the fixed rendering pipeline in OpenGL to develop a 3D game using C++. Originally, the game was based on a tv show called "Bamzooki" which was a show where you could create and battle creatures. As the project continued, I decided to move it into a 1v1 game with two snails, until settling with the idea of a 1v1 Tank game, where the goal was to knock the other opponent off the stage.

This project was a lot of fun to work on, and gave me a great understanding on working with OpenGL
