Draw Elements requires each indices, to link to the same position of tex coord, vertices and normal

POSSIBLE FIX
------------

MeshLoader
Move vertices from Vector into the final array
When applying the Vertex Indices, do the setting of position in the texcoord and normals array as the vertex indices position. This means for example if F is 1/4/2, Vertex index would be 0, texcoord index would be 0 and normal index would be 0, BUT contain the data from 1/4/2
